# About
One of two bigger assignment done as a part of our Advanced JavaScript course at Medieinstitutet.
Goal was to learn Angular and REST APIs.
This was a very fun and challenging project where I grew to appreciate Angular as a framework with its structure and versatile approach to Frontend development.
